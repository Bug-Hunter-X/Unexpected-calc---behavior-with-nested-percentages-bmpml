Instead of relying solely on percentage calculations within nested elements, use absolute or fixed pixel values as a baseline for nested elements. This way, the `calc()` function will have a concrete value to work with. For instance, If you need to calculate width relative to parent and apply padding and border, use a helper class that sets the base width in px and then use calc to compute the width.
